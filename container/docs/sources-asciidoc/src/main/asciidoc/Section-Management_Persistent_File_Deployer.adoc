== Persistent Deployable Unit Management

JAIN SLEE provides a file deployer that greatly simplifies the management of JAIN SLEE deployable unit jars.
The deployer: 

* Handles the installation of enclosed JAIN SLEE components. 
* Automatically activates and deactivates services contained. 
* Handles the creation, removal, activation, deactivation, link binding and link unbinding of all Resource Adapter Entities. 

All operations are persistent, which means that unlike management done through JMX, these survive server shutdowns. 

[[_management_persistent_du_install]]
== Persistent Deployable Unit Install

To install a deployable unit jar simply copy the file to [path]_$JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments/_.
Child directories can be used.

[[_management_persistent_du_uninstall]]
== Persistent Deployable Unit Uninstall

To uninstall a deployable unit jar simply delete the file.

[[_management_persistent_deployer_additional_behavior]]
== Beyond Deployable Unit (Un)Install

The file deployer provides additional behavior then simply (un)install deployable unit jars, as done through the JAIN SLEE 1.1 DeploymentMBean:

Service (De)Activation::
  All services contained in the deployable unit jar are activated after the install, and deactivated prior to uninstall.
  On service activation, if there is an active service in the SLEE, with same service name and vendor, then it is considered an older version, and the SLEE deactivates it. The deactivation of the old, and activation of the new, is done smoothly in a single operation, allowing service upgrades with no down time.

Dependencies Management::
  The deployer puts the installation process on hold until all of the component's dependencies are installed and activated.
  When uninstalling, it waits for all of the components which depend on components inside the deployable unit to be uninstalled.
  After an install or uninstall, the deployer evaluates all operations on hold.

[[_management_persistent_deployer_deploy_config_extension]]
== Deploy-Config Extension

A deployable unit jar may include a deploy-config.xml file in its [path]_META-INF/_ directory.
This file provides additional management actions for persistent install/uninstall operations:

Resource Adaptor Entity Management::
  It is possible to specify RA entities, and the container will create and activate the RA entities after the deployable unit is installed.
  During the uninstall process, the container will deactivate and remove those RA entities.

Resource Adaptor Links Management::
  It is possible to specify RA links, and the container will bind those after the deployable unit is installed.
  When uninstalled, the container will unbind those RA links as well.
  The links are set for resource adapter entities created in the [path]_deploy-config.xml_ file.

This file should comply with the following schema:

----

The deploy-config.xml example above defines a resource adaptor entity named `SipRa`, to be created for the resource adaptor with id `ResourceAdaptorID[name=JainSipResourceAdaptor, vendor=net.java.slee.sip, version=1.2]`, and with a single config property named `javax.sip.PORT` of type `java.lang.Integer` and with value `5060`.
Additionally, a resource adaptor link named `SipRa` should be bound to the resource adaptor entity.

After the deployable unit is installed, the resource adaptor entity is created, activated and the resource adaptor link is bound.
Before the deployable unit is uninstalled, or the server is shutdown, the link is unbound, then the resource adaptor entity is deactivated, and finally the same resource adaptor entity is removed.
