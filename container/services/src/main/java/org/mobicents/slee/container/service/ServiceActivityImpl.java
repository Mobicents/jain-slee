/**
 *Service Activity Implementation.
 *The Administrator uses the SLEEï¿½s management interface to activate and deactivate Services. Each Service
 *has an associated Activity. The specific Java type for this Activity is ServiceActivity.
 *The SLEE fires a Service Started Event on a ServiceActivity object after the Service is started. A
 *Service is started after one of the following occurs:
 *<ul>
 * <li>The SLEE is in the Running state and a ServiceManagementMBean object is invoked to activate
 * the Service, or
 * <li> The SLEE becomes active when the SLEE transitions from the Starting to the Running state and
 *   the SLEE starts the Service because the persistent state of the Service says it should be active.
 *   SBBs register interest in Service Started Events like any other event using an event element in 
 *   their deployment descriptor. An SBB can only receive a Service Started Event fired by the SLEE as 
 *  an initial event since this event is fired only once on a ServiceActivity object, at the time 
 * the corresponding Service Activity begins.
 * <li>Service Started Events enable an SBB to be notified when a Service becomes active. For example, the root
 *  SBB of a Service may listen to Service Started Events by specifying the event type of the Service Started
 *  Event as an initial event type of the SBB. The root SBB of a Wake-up Service may reinstate timers from
 *  persistent data stored in Profile Tables. Daemon-like Service entities may also use the Service Started
 *  Event and Service Activity to keep them alive instead of creating and attaching to NullActivity objects.
 * </ul>
